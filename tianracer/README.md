# Tianracer
Tianracer is a series of low cost auotonomous vehicles controlled in closed-loop, which could follow input commands more faithfully. All series Tianracers are equipped with NVIDIA development boards, e.g, Jetson Nano, Jetson TX2, Xavier, etc. Basic version Tianracer can reach a maximum speed at 3m/s and pro version can reach 10m/s.   

## Introduction
[TianRacer ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/tianracer)
Our goal is to develop a low cost autonomous racing car with not only basic mapping, localization, navigation ability but also object detection, traffic light detection, lane keeping, etc. Now Tianracer inherits AI aiblity from Jetracer.  

## Purchase from Tianbot Official Taobao Store

# Instructions
## Installation

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/tianbot/tianracer.git
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```
## Simulation
Tianracer can be simulated in [F1tenth Simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_simulator).  Install the simulator first.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_simulator.git
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

Simulate Tianracer
```
roslaunch tianracer_navigation simulator_wall_following.launch
```

## Interfacing
Tianracer can be brought up all at once, or separately.
```
roslaunch tianracer_bringup tianracer_bringup.launch
```
### Tianracer Base
```
roslaunch tianracer_core tianracer_core.launch
```

### Lidar
```
roslaunch tianracer_bringup lidar.launch
```

### RGBD Camera (if applicable)
```
roslaunch tianracer_bringup rgbd_camera.launch
```

### USB Camera
```

```

### GPS (if applicable)
```
roslaunch tianracer_bringup gps.launch
```

## Mapping
After bringing up the Tianracer, we provide three methods to perform slam for 2D laser.

### GMapping
```
roslaunch tianracer_slam tianracer_gmapping.launch
```
### HectorSLAM
```
roslaunch tianracer_slam tianracer_hector.launch
```

```
roslaunch tianracer_slam tianracer_cartographer.launch
```
### Save the Map
Map will be saved as tianbot_office in tianracer_slam/maps/
```
roslaunch tianracer_slam map_save.launch
```

## Navigation
After saving the map, the map can be used to perform navigation.
```
roslaunch tianracer_navigation tianracer_teb_nav.launch
```
